## Social Network

Good day. My name is Justin Moreyl. With a small team of like-mined people, I am writing a social network for poets, writers, screenwriters,
publicists, and so on. We want to make a lot of useful features for network users such as rating, awards, competitions, the best writer of the month or year, etc.
<p>
Now I am quietly writing lessons - the first steps to implement a social network and post each lesson on my YouTube channel. I will leave here a link to my YouTube channel and we also have a telegram chat where we communicate, come up with something new and implement it in our project. We would like you to join our friendly chat too.
